                    <h3>How to maintain your flowers alive longer? <span id="italic">Posted on 31/10/2014 by Palo Onder</span></h3>
                    <p>I discovered an article by Joseph Castro, writer at Live Sience, which after couple of lines made me smile.</p>
                    <p>Who haven’t put in their home cut flowers into a vase with water and enjoyed having them, just to realise that after couple days they wilt and die. We all would have liked them to last a little bit longer and finally regret that we did not add something to the water.</p>
                    <p>According to the article, to prolong the life of fresh-cut flowers, florists recommend the use of commercial flower preservatives. These preservatives provide food in the form of sugar, avoiding harmful microorganisms, bacteria and fungus, and allowing the flowers to absorb nutrients more efficiently by lowering the pH in water.</p>
                    <p>Some people claim the benefits of many homemade vase solutions that are supposed to mimic the effects of commercial preservatives, like mixtures containing copper pennies, aspirin, sugar, vodka, or bleach But do these inventions actually work?</p>
                    <p>Let’s have a look at the proposed remedies one by one:</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="rightColumn" id="rightBlog">
                    <p>According to what Terri Nell, horticulturalist in the University of Florida, wrote in June 2004, copper pennies in fact contain copper but they are not soluble so there is no chance that the copper will be transferred into the water. So save you some time and keep your pennies in a tin in your drawer.</p>
                    <p>Aspirin is the second remedy mentioned since is known to bring down the pH in water. Nevertheless, there are many contradictory studies about its effectiveness for this purpose. So it’s best not to risk it and keep them for your headaches!!</p>
                    <p>Sugar is another popular ingredient which people stand by for. And it has a bit of true in it, sugar feeds the flowers but also promotes micro bacteria that will make our flowers die fed but quickly. So best to keep the sugar for your coffee!!</p>
                    <p>So that just leaves us with the Vodka. If you really want to waste some time, your beloved flowers and that expensive bottle of the Russian spirit, try it! Even though I would suggest you the following:  get a tall tumbler, fill it with Ice and a slice of lime, a good slug of Vodka and top up with tonic. After a few of these you won’t even care about the flowers!!</p>
                    <p>But now seriously, the best way to keep your fresh-cut flowers longer is either to add a commercial flower preservative sachet or use this trade secret recipe which I use myself when I run out of preservatives and there is no supplier to hand.</p>
                    <p>Add just a little bit of sugar to the water and then add a little drop of bleach. Change the water of the vase everyday adding the sugar and the bleach and don’t forget to clean the vase thoroughly when changing the water.</p>
